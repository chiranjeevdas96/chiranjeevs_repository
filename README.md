# Chiranjeev's Repository
Hi! I am Chiranjeev Das. I am a student of Biosciences and Bioinformatics at Tezpur University, India. I created this repo to store code created for school assignments and personal projects.

If for any reason you wish to get in touch, you can do so at chiranjeevdas1996[at]gmail[dot]com.
Oh and I also like clicking pictures of things. Check me out on Instagram @chiranjeevdas96.

Cheers!
